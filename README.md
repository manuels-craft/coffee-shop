I created this project to highlight what’s possible with the basics taught in "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App"—even limited knowledge can go a long way when applied creatively.

Later on, I will be updating this project to include other technologies covered in the "Responsive Web Design" curriculum. I see this as an opportunity to watch a web project grow from the ground up.
